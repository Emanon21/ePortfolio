# ePortfolio
## CS499 Final Project
## Overview
This repository showcases my skills in software development, including Software Design and Engineering, Algorithms and Data structures, and Database Management. It contains my final project artifacts, including original and enhanced code, milestone narratives, and a professional self-assessment.

### Software Design and Development

This document describes the artifact for Database Management, including when it was created and why it was selected for my ePortfolio. It explains how this artifact demonstrates my skills, reflects on the enhancement process, and discusses what I learned and the challenges I faced.

### Self-Assessment
Over the course of this project, Iâ€™ve improved my skills in three key areas: Software Design and Engineering, Algorithms, and Data Structures. The purpose of this final project is to create an ePortfolio that showcases my skills to potential employers.

This project has helped me become a better developer by improving my ability to design efficient software solutions, implement complex algorithms, and manage databases effectively. I focused on enhancing my coding practices, debugging skills, and understanding of software development best practices, such as version control and testing.

I am proud of the progress I have made but I know that there is always more to learn. I want to keep expanding my skills and challenge myself with more tasks in the future to keep enhancing my skills.

### Code-Review
In my code review, I explained the purpose of the code and provided a breakdown of how each function works.
